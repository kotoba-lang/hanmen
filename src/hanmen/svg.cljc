(ns hanmen.svg
  "A `hanmen.page` drawn as SVG — safe to put inside a `default-src 'none'`
  page.

  ## Why SVG, and why that is not the contradiction it looks like

  The host this was built for serves uploaded bytes with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` and keeps SVG out of its inline allowlist
  on purpose: an SVG is XML, it may contain `<script>`, and a browser runs it
  when it is a document rather than an `<img>` source. Emitting SVG to show a
  PDF therefore has to answer that objection rather than ignore it, and the
  answer is that these are two different things wearing one file extension.

  The refused one is **bytes a user uploaded**, whose element set is whatever
  they wrote. This one is **markup this namespace generates** from a value
  whose vocabulary is `hanmen.page/item-kinds` — three kinds, each emitting a
  fixed element with a fixed attribute list. There is no path from document
  content to an element name or an attribute name; content only ever becomes
  an escaped text node or an escaped attribute *value*.

  That is a property of the code rather than a promise about it, and
  `serialize` enforces it a second time at the boundary: an element not in
  `allowed-elements` or an attribute not in `allowed-attributes` throws
  instead of being written. A single check would be enough if the emitter
  never changed. Two are enough when it does.

  Inline in the page rather than a `data:` URI in an `<img>` for the same
  reason: a `data:` URI is a *load*, and a page whose CSP is `default-src
  'none'` has to be widened to permit it. Markup in the document is not a
  load and needs no widening. Deciding what a page may load is a decision on
  its own, not a side effect of adding a viewer.

  ## Nothing here picks a colour, a font or a size

  Everything paints in `currentColor` and carries a class. The host's
  stylesheet — its `--hig-*` tokens, its theme — decides what the ink looks
  like, which is the only way one rendering can be right in both light and
  dark. A document's own black is not the reader's black on a dark page, and
  a viewer that emitted `#000` would be unreadable in exactly the mode people
  read long documents in.

  Ink *density* is preserved: a 60% grey rule stays lighter than a black one,
  through `fill-opacity`, because that difference is the document's meaning
  and the absolute colour is not."

            [hanmen.page :as page]))

(def allowed-elements
  "Every element this may emit. `foreignObject` is absent for the obvious
  reason and `style` for the less obvious one: a stylesheet in the fragment
  would be a second place styling is decided, and the host's is the only one."

(def allowed-attributes
  "Per element, so that `href` cannot appear on `text` by a typo or on `svg`
  by a future edit.

  `image/href` is the one URL in the file and it is worth saying exactly what
  it is and is not. It appears ONLY when the caller passes `:image-href`, so a
  host that has not decided its CSP gets a fragment that loads nothing. The
  URL is what that function returned; the item it was called with carries an
  integer index and never the `/XObject` name, so there is no path from
  document content into a URL even when images are on. `emit-image` refuses a
  returned value that is not a same-origin path, which is the check that makes
  that a property rather than a convention."
