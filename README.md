# hanmen（版面）

**A page, as placed marks.** 版面 is the composed area of a printed page — the
type and rules as they sit on the paper, not the text that went into them. This
library is that value: a size, a rotation and a vector of marks with
coordinates, plus one producer (PDF) and one drawer (SVG).

Portable `.cljc`, one dependency (`org-iso-pdf`), no host effects. Reading a
file is the caller's capability to spend; nothing here opens anything.

```clojure
(require '[hanmen.pdf :as hpdf] '[hanmen.svg :as svg])

(def page (hpdf/page-at (pdf.core/parse bytes) 0))
(svg/->svg page {:fit-to [900 1200]})   ;; => "<svg …>" — inert, themeable
```

## Why this exists

`org-iso-pdf` answers what is *in* a document. `pdf.core/extract-text` returns
the strings shown between `BT` and `ET` — enough to search, and nothing to look
at, because it has no text matrix. A viewer is entirely a question of *where*.

`kotoba-lang/app-preview` had the other half: a catalog of pages with sizes,
rotations and text counts. Between "what a page weighs" and "what a page says"
there was no value describing what a page *looks like*, so there was nothing to
draw.

## Three decisions

**The coordinate space is the reader's.** PDF puts the origin at the bottom
left with y up; SVG, Canvas and every raster buffer put it at the top left with
y down. The flip happens once, here, because a viewer that flips is a viewer
that can flip twice — and an upside-down page is a bug only a human eye catches.
Rotation is applied for the same reason: `:page/width` is the width **as seen**.

**A run's start is exact and its width is optional.** Where text begins comes
out of the matrices and is arithmetic. How wide it is depends on the font's
`/Widths`, which a document only sometimes ships. When they are there the run
carries its measured width and a drawer can make its own font occupy exactly
that space; when they are not, the width is **absent rather than estimated** —
an estimate would be indistinguishable from a measurement downstream and wrong
by a different amount on every document.

**A form XObject is run, not outlined.** A form is a content stream with its
own `/Matrix` and `/Resources` — a figure, a stamp, a letterhead — and a viewer
that draws its bounding box instead produces a page of empty rectangles.
Measured: across 30 real PDFs this turned 1,957 dashed boxes into marks, and
one 24 MB document went from *"scanned, no text"* to 2,932 text runs. Recursion
is depth-bounded and cycle-guarded, and where it stops it says so.

**What still cannot be drawn is placed and marked, never skipped.** A shading, a
`/Type0` run with no `/ToUnicode`: each becomes a `:frame` with a label and a
reason — and the label names the CMap that would decode it (`Adobe-Japan1`), so
the answer is something a reader can act on. A page that quietly omits a mark
looks exactly like a page that is complete, and `hanmen.svg/emit-item` throws on
an unknown kind rather than dropping it, so a fifth item kind cannot be added on
one side only.

## The SVG is safe inside `default-src 'none'`

Hosts that serve uploaded bytes keep SVG out of their inline allowlist on
purpose — an SVG is XML, it may carry `<script>`, and a browser runs it when it
is a document. This emitter is the other thing wearing that extension: markup
generated from a closed vocabulary of three item kinds, where document content
only ever becomes an escaped text node or an escaped attribute *value*. There
is no path from a file to an element name.

`serialize` enforces that a second time — an element outside `allowed-elements`
or an attribute outside `allowed-attributes` throws instead of being written.
No element here takes a URL, so the fragment loads nothing and the host's CSP
does not have to be widened to show a page. Deciding what a page may load is a
decision on its own, not a side effect of adding a viewer.

## Paths, not only rectangles

`re … f` was the only path this understood, so a chart, a logo and a
signature were all equally invisible. Every construction operator is run now
— `m` `l` `c` `v` `y` `h` `re` — and every painting one decides what the
accumulated path becomes. Across 47 real documents that is **28,966 paths
that previously produced nothing at all**.

A path made only of rectangles still becomes `:rule`s, one per rectangle,
because `re … f` is most of what documents draw and a box is worth more to a
consumer laying marks out than a closed four-segment path. Mix a rectangle
with a curve and it is one `:path`.

`d` is SVG path data, already transformed into reader space — every drawer
this could target accepts it, the grammar is tiny and closed, and a segment
vocabulary would be a second spelling every consumer has to translate back.
The bounding box is the control hull, so it can be larger than the ink and
never smaller: the safe direction for a value whose job is deciding what to
throw away.

Fill and stroke carry separate ink, because lower-case colour operators set
one and upper-case the other — treating them as one is how a hairline table
border ends up the colour of the cell behind it.

## The clip is honoured, as a box

`W n` marks the current path as the clip and ends it without painting. A
reader that ignored it draws what the document hides — a caption from under
a cropped figure, a row from a table that was scrolled. Measured across 47
documents: **112 text runs the document does not show**.

Tracked as a bounding box rather than the path, and the direction of that
error is chosen: a circular clip's box keeps the corners, so this shows a
little more than the document does. Showing slightly too much is a mark
drawn where the document drew nothing; showing too little is a mark
**missing**, and a reader cannot tell a missing mark from a document that
never had one.

The clip is part of the graphics state, so `q`/`Q` save and restore it —
including restoring it to *absent*, which `merge` alone cannot do and which
would otherwise leave a narrowed clip swallowing the rest of the page.

## Ink, and text that is knocked out of it

Every fill-colour operator records ink — `g`, `rg`, `k`, and the
space-dependent `sc`/`scn`, chosen by operand arity because that is what
actually distinguishes them. Tracking only the first two left a CMYK fill
recording nothing and drawing at full strength, which is the PDF default and
therefore not obviously wrong until you look at a poster.

Text carries ink too. It was the one mark that did not, which is invisible on
the documents everybody has — black on white — and wrong on a heading
reversed out of a dark panel, where it drew the text in the same ink as the
panel beneath it. Low-ink text paints in `var(--hanmen-paper, canvas)`: a
threshold rather than an opacity, because text at 0.3 of the ink is not faint
text, it is unreadable text.

## It picks no colour and no font

Everything paints in `currentColor` under a class. The host's tokens decide
what the ink looks like, which is the only way one rendering is right in both
light and dark — a document's black is not the reader's black on a dark page.
Ink *density* survives (a 60% grey rule stays lighter than a black one, through
`fill-opacity`), because that difference is the document's meaning and the
absolute colour is not. Add `hanmen.svg/stylesheet` to the host's stylesheet.

## Images are the host's decision, and the default is inert

An `:image` item carries **the index of the image on its page, never its
name** — a name is file content and would end up in a URL; an integer cannot
carry anything a document wrote. `hanmen.pdf/page-images` resolves an index
back to bytes **through the same traversal that assigned it**, because the
page's `/XObject` dictionary is in resource order and the two agree only on a
document that never invokes a form.

A `DCTDecode` XObject **is** a JPEG. A host can serve those bytes as one with
no decoder at all — 12 of the 57 images in the sample. The rest are raw samples
and `:media-type` is nil, which says somebody has to encode them rather than
guessing a type that arrives at a browser as a broken image. `:bits`,
`:colorspace` and `:palette` come with them, because a byte count alone
cannot tell 16-bit gray from 8-bit RGB — they are the same bytes per pixel.
Reported, never converted: turning CMYK into RGB is a decision about what a
colour means, and this library does not have the host's answer.

`hanmen.svg` draws an image only when the caller passes `:image-href`, and
refuses anything that is not a same-origin path:

```clojure
(svg/->svg page {:image-href (fn [{:keys [index]}]
                               (str "/api/…/pages/3/images/" index))})
```

Without it the region is outlined like a frame and **the fragment loads
nothing**, so a host that has not decided its CSP is not forced to.

## One `Tj` per glyph is a real thing producers do

An audit-report cover emitted **52 runs for one line**, so `text-of` returned
`["O" "p" "e" "n" …]` — not a search index and not a quotation. Drawn in a
font that is not the document's, each glyph at its own document x, it read as
`Cont r act s`, and a reader blames the renderer.

`coalesce` joins runs that are exactly contiguous — the pen's end position is
known from the advance, so it is an equality test and not a guess. Three
outcomes, because a gap means three things: nothing is one word, a word space
is one phrase with the space put back, and anything wider ends the run. That
last threshold is what stops a two-column line becoming one sentence.

Measured across 47 real documents: text runs 11,568 → 5,681, runs of a single
character 72.4% → 38.0%, and characters 20,909 → **27,276** — the rise is the
word spaces coming back.

## Reading order is a guess, kept apart from the fact

`text-of` is what the document says in the order it said it. `reading-order`
groups into columns and sorts down the page and across the line, rounding
baselines into bands so a superscript does not jump the word it belongs to.
Two columns are inferred only when both halves carry a real share of the text
and almost nothing straddles the gutter; three are never inferred, because
nothing in the measured sample had three and a heuristic that can produce an
unchecked answer will produce it on somebody's invoice.

A caller that needs the fact should not have to opt out of the guess, which is
why these are two functions.

## What it does not do

- **No raster decoding.** `FlateDecode` samples come back raw; encoding them to
  something a browser renders is the host's job (`kotoba-lang/org-w3-png`).
- **No shading, patterns or transparency groups.** `sh` paints the clip
  region, and the clip path is not tracked; a pattern fill leaves the
  previous colour rather than inventing an average.
- **CID→Unicode without `/ToUnicode` needs a table from the host.** Measured across 160 documents and
  576 `/Type0` fonts: 549 ship one and are read; 25 do not and are
  `CIDFontType0C`; 2 have no embedded font; **zero** are the SFNT case an
  embedded-`cmap` fallback would have fixed. Bare CFF has no `cmap` table, so
  decoding those needs its charset plus a registry CMap resource
  (Adobe-Japan1-UCS2 and siblings), and neither exists here yet. The frame
  names both the ordering and the font kind so the next person does not
  repeat that dead end. `opentype.cmap` was written for the fallback and is
  deliberately NOT wired in — a dependency for a path that fires on zero of
  576 fonts is not a dependency.
- **No zoom or pan.** `fit` answers the one number a server-side render needs.
  Viewport gestures are `kotoba-lang/canvaskit`'s subject.
- **No writing.** A viewer that can rewrite what it is showing is a different
  program.

## Test

```sh
clojure -M:local:test   # sibling checkouts
clojure -M:test         # pinned git deps
clojure -M:lint
```

66 tests / 232 assertions. Every placement assertion is a coordinate against a
PDF the test wrote, not a rendering somebody looked at.

Measured out of sample against 30 real PDFs: 12,584 text runs, 2,083 rules, 57
images, **0 XObject regions left undrawn**.
