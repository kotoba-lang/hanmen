  "A PDF page's content stream, walked, into `hanmen.page` marks.

  ## Why this is not in `org-iso-pdf`

  `org-iso-pdf` is the COS object model: objects, xref, the page tree, stream
  filters. A content stream is not part of that model — it is a *program* in a
  small stack language, and running it needs a graphics state, a text state
  and a matrix stack that the object model has no reason to own. Keeping the
  interpreter out of the spec repo is the same boundary `pdf.core` already
  draws when it hands back opaque `DCTDecode` bytes rather than decoding them.

  What `org-iso-pdf` does offer and this uses: `parse`, `pages`,
  `page-content-str` and `resolve-ref`. Nothing here re-reads the file.

  ## What placement actually requires

  `pdf.core/extract-text` collects the strings between `BT` and `ET`. That is
  the right answer for search and no answer at all for a viewer: it has no
  `Tm`, so every run in the document is at the same place, which is nowhere.

  Placing a run means carrying two matrices — the CTM, which `q`/`Q`/`cm`
  move, and the text matrix, which `Tm`/`Td`/`T*` move and which every glyph
  advances. The run's origin is `Trm` applied to the origin, and `Trm` is
  `[Tfs·Th 0 0 Tfs 0 Trise] × Tm × CTM`. There is no shortcut: a producer that
  emits one `Tm` and then a hundred `TJ`s — which is most of them — puts every
  line after the first in the wrong place if the advance is not accumulated.

  ## Advance width is the honest part

  Where a run *starts* is exact: it comes out of the matrices. How wide it is
  depends on the font's glyph widths, and a document only sometimes ships
  them. When `/Widths` is there this computes the run's width in text space
  and `hanmen.page/text-item` carries it, so a drawer can make its own font
  occupy exactly that much. When it is not — a composite font, a standard-14
  font with no `/Widths` — the width is **absent rather than estimated**, and
  the drawer starts the run correctly and ends it wherever its font lands.

  An estimate would be indistinguishable from a measurement in the output and
  wrong by a different amount on every document. Absence is a fact a consumer
  can act on.

  ## CJK is decoded through `/ToUnicode` or not claimed

  A composite (`/Type0`) font's codes are not characters — with `Identity-H`
  they are glyph ids, and mapping them needs the font's `/ToUnicode` CMap.
  This reads `beginbfchar` / `beginbfrange` and uses it.

  A run neither route can read becomes a `:frame` marked
  `:font/no-tounicode` rather than a run of mojibake: text nobody can read
  is worse than a marked region, because it goes into search results and
  into anything that quotes the page.

  ## What is actually missing when that happens, measured

  The obvious fallback is the embedded font's own `cmap`, read backwards —
  `opentype.cmap` exists for exactly that. It is **not wired in here, and
  the measurement is why**. Across 160 real documents and 576 `/Type0`
  fonts: 549 ship `/ToUnicode` and are already read; 25 do not and are
  `CIDFontType0C`; 2 have no embedded font at all; and **zero** are the SFNT
  case the `cmap` route would have helped.

  `CIDFontType0C` is bare CFF and has no `cmap` table to read. Decoding one
  needs its charset (CID per glyph) and then a registry CMap resource —
  Adobe-Japan1-UCS2 and its siblings — neither of which exists in this
  workspace. So the frame names both the ordering and the font kind, and the
  next person does not repeat the dead end this docstring records."

(def ^:private flush-fraction
  "How much slack counts as *flush*, as a fraction of the type size.

  Only flush runs join, and **no space is ever inserted**. That is a
  reversal, and the measurement that caused it is worth keeping: on a real
  cover page the gaps between consecutive glyphs formed one continuous
  spread from 0.30 to 0.90 em with no gap in the histogram anywhere. There
  is no threshold on that page that separates letter-spacing from a word
  space — every choice invents characters somewhere, and the first version
  of this put one between every pair of letters
  (`F o r m  a l V e r i f i c a t i o n`).

  Inventing a space is exactly the mistake this library refuses elsewhere:
  a guess that is indistinguishable from a measurement once it is in the
  output, and one that goes into `text-of` and into anything quoting the
  page. So runs that the producer placed apart stay apart, at their own
  coordinates, which is what the document actually says. A caller that wants
  a line joins them — `reading-text` does, with a space, and that is a
  presentation choice made at the edge rather than a character smuggled into
  the model."
  0.05)

(defn coalesce
  "Consecutive text runs that are one word, joined into one.

  ## Why this is not cosmetic

  A producer is free to emit one `Tj` per glyph, and plenty do — kerning
  each pair individually is the easiest way to place type exactly. Measured:
  an audit-report cover emitted 52 runs for one line, so `text-of` returned
  `[\"O\" \"p\" \"e\" \"n\" …]`. That is not a search index and it is not a
  quotation; it is a page nobody can read out of.

  It is also what makes a drawn page look wrong. Each glyph placed at its own
  document x, in a font that is not the document's, spaces unevenly — the
  reader sees `Cont r act s` and blames the renderer. Joined, the browser
  lays the word out itself and only the WORD's start comes from the
  document, which is both truer and better looking.

  ## Two thresholds, because a gap means three different things

  Nothing (`< space-fraction`) is one word; a word space
  (`< join-fraction`) is one phrase with a space put back; anything wider
  ends the run. The last one is what stops a two-column line from becoming
  a single sentence, and it is the failure that would be loud — the other
  direction, losing every space, still looks like text.

  **Both of the wider two need a MEASURED advance.** When the font shipped
  no `/Widths` the pen position is computed from `default-width`, and a gap
  derived from a guess is not evidence of anything: the real glyph is often
  wider, so the gap appears inside a word. Measured on a real cover page,
  where it produced `Form alVerification of |penZeppelin`. Unmeasured runs
  therefore join only when they are flush, and never gain a space.

  ## Joined only when they are exactly contiguous

  The pen's end position is known (`::end-x`, from the advance), so this is
  an equality test and not a guess: a run joins the previous one when it
  starts where the previous one ended. A gap wider than that gets a space if
  it is wide enough to be one, and otherwise starts a new run — so a two-
  column line never becomes one word, and a tab stop does not swallow the
  gap it was there to make.

  Same baseline, same size, same font, same ink, same direction: anything
  else is a different piece of type and stays its own run."

  "The marks that are on the page.

  A content stream may draw anywhere; the page box is what the reader sees,
  and PDF clips to it. Measured on a real poster: a rule at (9321, 10277) on
  a 2384×3370 page — four page-widths off the edge. Harmless to a drawer
  whose viewBox clips it, and not harmless to a count of what is on the
  page, a digest over the marks, or anything that lays them out itself.

  Only the far side, and only on the item's own start point. A text run's
  `x` is a baseline START and its width is absent whenever the font shipped
  no `/Widths` — so treating an unmeasured run as zero-wide and dropping it
  for starting at −5 would delete text that is on the page. It did, on the
  first run of this: the second half of a `TJ` whose kerning pulled it left
  past the origin.

  So a mark is dropped when it BEGINS past the right or bottom edge, which
  is the case that was measured, and when a known positive extent puts it
  entirely off the left or top. Anything else stays whole — trimming a
  straddler would need the clip path this does not track, and half a letter
  is worse than a letter that runs off."

(defn page-dicts
  "`pdf.core/pages`, minus the one it invents for a file that is not a PDF.

  `collect-pages` walks from `(:Pages (:root parsed))`, and when the root is
  nil — no catalog, no trailer, because the bytes were never a PDF — its
  `:else` branch returns `[{}]`. One empty map, which counts as one page.
  Measured: a text file uploaded as `application/pdf` reported a page and
  rendered blank, which is the answer that sends somebody looking for the
  missing content of a document that was never there.

  A page dict says it is one, or carries content, or carries a box. A blank
  page of a real document has the last two even with no content stream, so
  this drops the phantom without dropping a legitimately empty page."
