  "版面 — one page, as placed marks in a coordinate space anybody can draw.

  ## What this is for

  `org-iso-pdf` answers what is *in* a document: the object graph, the page
  tree, the strings shown between `BT`/`ET`. It does not answer where any of
  it is, and a viewer is entirely a question of where. `pdf.core/extract-text`
  returns a vector of strings in content-stream order — enough to search,
  nothing to look at.

  So this namespace is the value in between: a page is a size, a rotation and
  a vector of **placed** items. Nothing here parses a format and nothing here
  draws; `hanmen.pdf` fills it and `hanmen.svg` draws it, and a second
  producer (an image, a `kasane` document, a Drive workbook) is a second
  producer rather than a second viewer.

  ## The coordinate space is the reader's, not the format's

  PDF user space has its origin at the bottom-left and y increasing upward.
  SVG, Canvas, CoreGraphics-in-UIKit and every raster buffer put it at the
  top-left with y increasing downward. One of those has to be the space this
  value is in, and it is the reader's: `[0 0]` is the top-left corner of the
  page as displayed, x grows right, y grows down, and the unit is the page's
  own (a PDF point, 1/72 inch).

  Doing the flip here rather than in each drawer is the whole point. A viewer
  that flips is a viewer that can flip twice, and a page drawn upside-down is
  a bug that only a human eye catches.

  ## Rotation is applied, not reported

  `/Rotate 90` on a page means the reader sees it turned. `app-preview.model`
  already learned that reporting the unrotated box lays out every thumbnail
  grid wrongly, so `:page/width` and `:page/height` here are the size **as
  seen**, and the marks inside are already turned to match. A consumer that
  wanted the unrotated box would have to un-rotate, which nothing wants.

  Everything here is pure and portable: no store, no clock, no host."

(def item-kinds
  "What a page can contain, and what each one means.

  A closed set. A drawer switches on this key exhaustively, so a kind added
  here without a case there is a mark that silently disappears — which is why
  `hanmen.svg/emit-item` throws on an unknown kind rather than skipping it.

  `:image` is a region whose pixels exist and are NOT in this value. It
  carries the index of the image on its page, never its name: a name comes out
  of the file, and an index cannot carry anything a document wrote. A drawer
  that has somewhere to fetch pixels from can draw it; one that has not falls
  back to outlining the region, which is what `hanmen.svg` does by default.

  `:path` is everything a pen draws that is not an axis-aligned rectangle: a
  curve, a diagonal, a polygon, a chart's plot line. It carries the path
  already flattened into reader space, so a drawer emits it and does not do
  geometry. `:rule` stays a separate kind rather than becoming a four-corner
  path, because a rectangle is most of what documents actually draw and a
  consumer that lays marks out itself can reason about a box and cannot
  reason about a cubic.

  `:frame` is the honest one. A shading, a pattern, a `/Type0` run nobody can
  decode: a region of the page whose contents this does not have, where a
  viewer that drew nothing would show a page that looks complete and is not.
  So the region is placed, named and marked as undrawn. Silence is the one
  thing it must not be."

  it belongs to. Rounding to a band the height of the text makes them equal
